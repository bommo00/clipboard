[win] FLET
[ios] FLET/Swift (under process)

##Unsolve issue: Here is a need to have some refactoring of timestamp function now. ##

#Usage

  -You need to sign up for the first time, and won't be bothered for among 6 months;

  -Type in what you want to copy into other device, and ENTER to send them;

  -Refresh to receive new text inputs; 

  -You would be able to get the text in YOUR clipboard by one click of the text botton;

  -Long-click to make the text fixed otherwise the texts would be deleted after once closing the application (Blue bgcolor:fixed);
